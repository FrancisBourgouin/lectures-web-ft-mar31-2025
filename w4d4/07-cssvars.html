    <button>PARTY TIME!</button>
    <p>
      There's a magical ritual that unfolds each morning, a comforting dance between
      dawn's first light and the tantalizing aroma of freshly brewed coffee. As the sun's
      tentative rays pierce through the curtains, the anticipation
      <span
        >of that first sip awakens the senses in a way that few other moments can. The
        morning cup of coffee is more than a beverage; it's </span
      >an invitation to savor the simple pleasures of life. The rich, earthy scent fills
      the air, wrapping you in its warm embrace, coaxing the drowsiness
      <span
        >from your body and infusing you with a renewed sense of purpose. With each sip,
        the world slowly transforms from a hazy dreamscape into sharp </span
      >focus, aligning thoughts and ideas like stars falling into alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it's not just the physical awakening that makes morning
      <span
        >coffee so wondrous. It's the brief respite it offers, a fleeting moment of
        solitude in a world that's always in motion. As you cradle t</span
      >he mug in your hands, you're transported to a tranquil oasis where time slows down,
      and worries fade away. The first taste is a symphony of flavors, a harmonious blend
      of bitterness and warmth that
      <span
        >dances across your taste buds, a symphony of sensations that stirs the soul. It's
        a daily reminder that life's pleasures need not </span
      >be grandiose; sometimes, it's the uncomplicated joy of a perfectly brewed cup that
      elevates the ordinary to the extraordinary.
